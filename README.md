DMBelt
======

Handy tool for Dungeon Masters!

Design Goal:
DMBelt is designed to be a DM'ing aide for Pen & Paper RPGs that is both extensible and composable.  The baseline composition will be based on the Pathfinder RPG system and will include the ability to save/load character sheets from .xml files.  It will also contain a combat simulator module designed to expedite calculations and catlog combat data in a visually appealing fashion.
