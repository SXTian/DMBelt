DMBelt
======

Handy tool for Dungeon Masters!

##Design Goal

DMBelt is designed to be a DM'ing aide for Pen & Paper RPGs that is both extensible and composable.  The baseline composition will be based on the Pathfinder RPG system and will include the ability to save/load character sheets from .xml files.  It will also contain a combat simulator module designed to expedite calculations and catlog combat data in a visually appealing fashion.

##Overview

This is something I've always wanted to make as I play tabletop RPGs quite frequently.  This is my ongoing attempt to do just that as well as broadening my horizons by learning WPF and XAML.

This project is still very very much in the early stages of development so do not expect to see too many features (yet). 

At the moment I am using GitHub as a way to easily work on my project from different locations, and for other to view some of my code if they are interested.  As such I have simply uploaded my Visual Studio source folder and its contents. You can view the source code by navigating inside that folder.
